ZeroMQ RFC
==========

This is the ZeroMQ RFC project.

We collect specifications for APIs, file formats, wire protocols, and processes.

The change process is C4: http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42 with a few modifications:

* A specification is created and modified by pull requests according to C4.
* Each specification has an editor who publishes the RFC to http://rfc.zeromq.org as needed.
* Specification lifecycle SHOULD follow the lifecycle defined in [COSS](http://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:2/COSS)
* Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on Raw and Draft specifications.
