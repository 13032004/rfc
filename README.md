ZeroMQ RFC
==========

This is the ZeroMQ RFC project.

We collect specifications for APIs, file formats, wire protocols, and processes.

The change process is C4: http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42 with a few modifications:

* A specification is created and modified by pull requests according to C4.
* Each specification has an editor who publishes the RFC to http://rfc.zeromq.org as needed.
* Each specification uses one of these tags to define its status:
  * __raw__ - new specification
  * __draft__ - has at least one implementation.
  * __stable__ - has been deployed to real users.
  * __legacy__ - is being replaced by newer specifications.
  * __retired__ - has been replaced and is no longer used.
  * __deleted__ - abandoned before becoming stable.
* Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on Raw and Draft specifications.
